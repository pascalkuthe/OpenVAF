OpenVAF is a Verilog-A compiler that can compile Verilog-A files for use in circuit simulator.
The major aim of this Project is to provide a high-quality standard compliant compiler for Verilog-A.
Furthermore, the project aims to bring modern compiler construction algorithms/data structures to a field with a lack of such tooling.

Some highlights of OpenVAF include:

* **fast compile** times (usually below 1 second for most compact models)
* high-quality **user iterface**
* **easy setup** (no runtime dependencies even for cross compilation)
* **fast simulations** surpassing existing solutions by 30%-60%, often matching handwritten models
* IDE aware design

Detailed documentation, examples and precompiled binaries of all release are **available on our [website](https://openvaf.semimod.de)**. To test the latest development version you can download nightly version of OpenVAF for [linux](https://openva.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/openvaf_devel-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz) or [windows](https://openva.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/openvaf_devel-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.tar.gz).


## Projects

The development of OpenVAF and related tools is tightly coupled and therefore happens in a single repository.
This repository currently contains the following useable projects:

### OpenVAF

OpenVAF is the main project of the repository and all other tools use OpenVAF as a library in some form.
OpenVAF can be build as a standalone CLI program that can compile Verilog-A files to shared objects that comply with the simulator independent OSDI interface.

OpenVAF has been tested with a preliminary NGSPICE prototype and Melange.
It can already support a large array of compact models.
However, due to the larger feature set (compared to VerilogAE) additional testing and verification is still required.
Furthermore, some Verilog-A language features are currently not supported.

### VerilogAE

Allows obtaining model equations (calculates the value of a single Variable) from Verilog-A files.
VerilogAE is primarily useable from python (available on pypi) but can also be compiled as a static/shared library and called by any programming language (that supports the C ABI).

VerilogAE is used in production at SemiMod and various partners.
Its stable and ready for general use.

### Melange

Melange is an experimental circuit simulator that leverage OpenVAF to gain access to compact models.
This allows it to easily support a large array of models without the huge effort associated with traditional simulators.
The focus of Melange is primarily on automation.
That means Melange focuses on providing an ergonomic and extensible API in mainstream programming languages (python and rust currently) instead of a special purpose netlist format.
However, to remain compatible with existing PDKs a subset of the spectre netlist format can be parsed.

Melange is currently in early development and most features are not complete.
Some mockups of planned usage can be found in `melange/examples`.
Some working minimal examples (in rust) can be found in `melange/core/test.rs`.

## Building OpenVAF using docker

Building OpenVAF requires a specific version of LLVM-14 which can be difficult to install. We are working on simplifying the process.
In the meantime it's recommended to use the official docker image for compiling OpenVAF. Simply run the following commands

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/pascalkuthe/OpenVAF.git && cd openvaf
# On REHL distros and fedora replace docker with podman
# on all commands below. 
docker pull ghcr.io/pascalkuthe/ferris_ci_build_x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu:latest
# On Linux distros that enable SELinux linux RHEL based distros and fedora use $(pwd):/io:Z
docker run -ti -v $(pwd):/io ghcr.io/pascalkuthe/ferris_ci_build_x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu:latest

# Now you are inside the docker container
cd /io
cargo build --release
# OpenVAF will be build this can take a while
# afterwards the binary is available in target/release/openvaf
# inside the repository 
```

## General Build Instructions 

OpenVAF **requires rust/cargo 1.64 or newer** (best installed with [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)).
Furthermore, the **LLVM-14** development libraries are required.
Older or newever versions of LLVM are not supported.


On debian based distros the [llvm provided packages](https://apt.llvm.org/) can be used.
Windows developers must compile LLVM themselves.

Once all dependencies are satisfied you can build the entire project by running:

``` shell
cargo build
```

By default, OpenVAF will link against the static LLVM libraries, to avoid runtime dependencies. This is great for creating portable binaries but sometimes building with shared libraries is preferable. Simply set the `LLVM_LINK_SHARED` environment variable during linking to use the shared system libraries. If multiple LLVM versions are installed (often the case on debian) the `LLVM_CONFIG` environment variable can be used to specify the path of the correct `llvm-config` binary.
An example build invocation using shared libraries on debian is shown below:

``` shell
LLVM_LINK_SHARED=1 LLVM_CONFIG="llvm-config-14" cargo build
```
OpenVAF includes many integration and unit tests inside its source code.
For development [cargo-nexttest](https://nexte.st/) is recommended to run these tests as it significantly reduces the test runtime.
However, the built-in cargo test runner (requires no extra installation) can also be used.
To run the testsuite simply call:

``` shell
cargo test # default test runner, requires no aditional installation
cargo nextest # using cargo-nextest, much faster but must be installed first
```

By default, the testsuite will skip slow integration tests that compile entire compact models.
These can be enabled by setting the `RUN_SLOW_TESTS` environment variable:

``` shell
RUN_SLOW_TESTS=1 cargo test 
```
